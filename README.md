# What

Quick 'n shitty script to ~~abuse~~ use the scryfall api for obtaining rough pricing on cards in your wishlist.

# How

1. Have a newline-delimited list of cards in some file, say `wishlist.txt`
2.  ```
    python3 pricer.py wishlist.txt [-c usd|usd_foil|eur|tix] [-s name|price] [-v [-v ...]]
    ```

# Why

Stop asking so many questions.
